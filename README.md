Time Series Forecasting for Portfolio Management Optimization

Project Overview

Guide Me in Finance (GMF) Investments is leveraging time series forecasting models to predict market trends, optimize asset allocation, and enhance portfolio performance. The primary goal is to help clients achieve their financial objectives by minimizing risks and capitalizing on market opportunities.

Project Objectives

Extract and preprocess financial data for key assets:

Tesla (TSLA)

Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND)

S&P 500 ETF (SPY)

Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends, patterns, and volatility.

Develop time series forecasting models to predict future stock prices.

Analyze forecast results and optimize portfolio allocation.

Recommend portfolio adjustments based on risk-return analysis.

Data Source

Data is extracted using the Yahoo Finance (yfinance) API.

The dataset spans from January 1, 2015, to January 31, 2025.

Data includes:

Date

Open, High, Low, Close prices

Adjusted Close prices (accounting for dividends and splits)

Volume

Key Tasks

Task 1: Data Preprocessing & Exploration

Load and clean financial data.

Check for missing values and handle them.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand stock price trends and volatility.

Task 2: Develop Forecasting Models

Choose between ARIMA, SARIMA, or LSTM models.

Split data into training and testing sets.

Train and evaluate the model using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.

Task 3: Forecast Future Market Trends

Use the trained model to predict future prices.

Visualize forecasts alongside actual historical data.

Analyze confidence intervals and potential market movements.

Task 4: Portfolio Optimization

Forecast future returns of TSLA, BND, and SPY.

Compute portfolio risk and return metrics (e.g., Sharpe Ratio, Value at Risk).

Optimize asset allocation to maximize returns while minimizing risk.

Expected Outcomes

Accurate price forecasts for TSLA, BND, and SPY.

Insights into market trends and volatility.

A well-optimized investment portfolio based on future predictions.
